<p>I am a Lecturer in Politics at <a class="highlight" href="https://www.univ.ox.ac.uk/">University College, Oxford</a> and a DPhil (PhD) Candidate at <a class="highlight" href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/">Nuffield College</a> and the <a class="highlight" href="https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Politics and International Relations (DPIR)</a> at the <a class="highlight" href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. Previously, I studied at the <a class="highlight" href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/">University of Essex</a> and the <a class="highlight" href="https://www.sc-politiche.unifi.it/changelang-eng.html">University of Florence</a>.</p>

<p>My research focuses on political representation and party competition, particularly in spatial terms, and on the role of social divisions and structure in politics. I have been studying changes in the policy platforms and ideological programs of political parties, social cleavages, party brands, and partisan alignments of political parties and voters.</p>

<p>I am also interested more broadly in questions on electoral politics and voting behaviour, electoral systems and electoral reform, democracy and state formation.</p>

<p>My work focuses on advanced industrial democracies, in both their contemporary and historical developments, with particular attention to Western Europe, and I primarily use quantitative methods.</p>

<p>Feel free to email me if you want to discuss my research or you are interested in talking about these and other topics.</p>
